## GitHub

* To work in the lab, first you will need to create a [github](https://github.com/) account and get added to our group

Tim created a script to setup your computer in one command. It will ask you to set up ssh keys on your GitHub account, as well as a few other various things.

It has run into trouble before, so you might have to run it several times. 

You will need to run it from your home directory first, and then subsequently it will expect to be run from `~/sawyer_ws`.
