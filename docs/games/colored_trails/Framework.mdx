# Explaination of Our Framework for Colored Trails

# GUI

The gui for the game is implemented in dart/flutter. It uses a seeded random number generator to generate the game board and players hands and simple logic to test the validity of the scenario.

## Pages

### Home Page

![HomePage](/img/colored_trails_home_page.jpg)

This page is used to launch the GUI in one of three modes: degub, player one, and player two.
Debug mode allows the game to be played in a tabbed window for simple debugging and self-human play, while either of the player options simply starts the GUI for that player.

### Server Connection

# Backend

Implemented in Python3, the backend is a server using socketio and eventlet. In the backend, new scenarios are generated and verified for validity, actions are recieved and precessed, and game phases are advanced. The Backend can handle multiple games at a time as different games are stored via a 4 letter gamecode which is used for all processes and actions for the games.

see [automatic mode](games/colored_trails/AutomaticMode) or [manual mode](games/colored_trails/ManualMode) for more detailed information
