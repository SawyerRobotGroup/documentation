## Phase Explaination

### Set Up

During the Set Up phase, the game board is generated and starting positions and goals are assigned. The hands are then delt and the whole scenario is tested for validity. If it is valid the round begins, otherwise a new scenario is generated.

Validity is determined by 2 criteria adapted from Gal et al. [^1].

- One of the players can reach the goal before or after trading
- Both players can not reach the goal before trading

### Pick and Take an Action

On a player's turn they may choose one of the following actions:

- Propose a Trade

- Place a Chip

- Pass Turn

- Declare Done for Round

#### Proposal a Trade and Counter Proposal

When proposing a trade a player will propose what chips that they would like to exchange with the other player and may deliberate with each other.

This will keep going until the players either reach a consensus or one player says they will no longer negotiate, at that point the trade occurs and the turn passes to the next player.

#### Place a Chip

If a player chooses to place a chip rather than make a trade, they can move there token to another spot by matching a clock next to them with a chip from their hand. They do this by clicking on a block they would like to move to. The backend will process the action and make sure it is a valid move. If it is valid, the players token is moved and then the turn passes, otherwise the UI tells the user that the move is invalid and asks them to choose a different action.

#### Pass Turn

At any point, a player may choose to take no actions at all and pass their turn, this is only for that turn and not for the round.

##### Declare Done for Round

At any point, a player may say they are 'Done'. This means that they will take no more actions for the duration of the round, the other player may still place chips, but may no longer propose a trade

#### Score

Scoring is as follows:

Score = alpha - lambda \* d ^ gama
Where alpha is max score, lambda is the decay constant and gama is the rate of decay and d is the distance between the player's position and the goal position.
Alpha, beta and gama are random numbers that satisfy the following conditions:

- 1.2 <= lambda <= 2.2
- 20 <= alpha <= 50
- gama = 1.75
