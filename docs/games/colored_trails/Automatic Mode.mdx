## Phase Explaination

### Set Up

During the Set Up phase, the game board is generated and starting positions and goals are assigned. The hands are then delt and the whole scenario is tested for validity. If it is valid the round begins, otherwise a new scenario is generated.

Validity is determined by 2 criteria adapted from Gal et al. [^1].

- One of the players can reach the goal before or after trading
- Both players can not reach the goal before trading

### Trade Proposal and Counter Proposal

During the Exchange Proposal and the Counter Proposal phases, players will propose what chips that they would like to exchange with the other player and may deliberate with each other.

This will keep going until the players either reach a consensus or one player says they will no longer negotiate.

### Trade and Score

Once a deal is made, the players chips will be exchanged by the game, the best path is calculated and taken automatically. Scores are then assigned.

#### Score

Scoring is as follows:

Score = alpha - lambda \* d ^ gama
Where alpha is max score, lambda is the decay constant and gama is the rate of decay and d is the distance between the player's position and the goal position.
Alpha, beta and gama are random numbers that satisfy the following conditions:

- 1.2 <= lambda <= 2.2
- 20 <= alpha <= 50
- gama = 1.75
