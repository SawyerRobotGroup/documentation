## Overview

Colored Trails is a cooperitive game used to test and study social interaction between players. We are using it to specifically study Human Robot interaction.

The game is a 2-player game consisting of an n x m board (where n and m are integers) of colored squares and a common goal square. Each player starts on one of the squares on the board and get a starting hand of k chips. These chips can be used to create a trail from the players starting position to the goal.

In our scenario n,m, and k all equal 4.

The code for this project is in: `game/server/server.py`, `game/server/games/colored_trails`, and `game/ui/colored_trails`
