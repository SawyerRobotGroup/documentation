## Overview

The Block Game is a resource sharing game where two players try to maximize their earnings by complete valid sets of 3 blocks. Each game consists of 9 blocks, 3 squares, 3 triangles, and 3 circles. Each set of shapes comes in 3 colors, purple, red, and blue. Players play a series of `n` rounds and take turns picking blocks to create a valid set. A valid set consists of all the same shape, all the same color, or all different shapes and colors.

The current code for this project is in: `game/control_panel`, `game/game_flow`

But is being replaced by: `game/server/server.py`, `game/server/games/block_game.py`, `game/agents`, and `game/ui/block_game`
