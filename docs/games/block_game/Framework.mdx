# GUI

The **Block Game** uses the [control panel](system/Control Panel.md) as the GUI for playing the game.

# Backend

Implemented in Python3 and C++, the backend consists of two main portions in the **Game Flow Module**, the ssharp algorithm in `game_flow/Algorithm` and the game flow control in `game_flow/Robot`. The game_flow communicated with the ssharp algorithm using sockets and with other subsystems using ROS publishers and services.
