### Phase Explaination

#### Negotiation Proposal

In human-human play, negotiations can be made at any time during the game.

To propose a negotiation, players may talk and ask for specific blocks or propose a strategy.

#### Set Up

To set up the game, all the blocks are placed in the play area. On the GUI, this is done automatically when a round finishes. In a physical game, the players must place the blocks back for the next turn to begin.

#### Take Actions

During each round, players take turns claiming a block until each player has 3 blocks. When a player claims a block, it is placed in their play area.

#### Scoring

Once 3 blocks have been claimed, they are scored automatically and the score is added to their total score.

Scoring is calculated by adding the values of each of the blocks claimed. If the blocks make a valid set, the sum is then added to the total score, if it is an invalid set, `1/4` of the sum is subtracted from the total score.

In **The Block Game** there are 4 main types of cooperation, as depicted below:

- Dysfunctional
- Domination
- Aloof
- Efficient

Dysfunctional Cooperation is when both players lose money during the round meaning that they prevented each other from getting valid sets.

Domination is when one player gets significantly more money than the other for multiple rounds.

Aloof Cooperation is when both players get money, but it is not the optimum amount.

Efficient Cooperation is when both players manage to cooperate to get the most money possible.
