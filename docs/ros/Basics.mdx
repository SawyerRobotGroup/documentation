### Some Helpful Tips:

- make sure that you add the following to your ~/.bashrc file, otherwise you will need to run the commands every time you open a new terminal:

  - `source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash`
  - `source ~/sawyer_ws/devel/setup.bash`

- make sure you do a **catkin_make** in the **sawyer_ws** directory after making any changed to msgs, files that need to be compiled (such as c++ files), or create new files

- before you can connect to Tibor you must _intera in_ by running **./intera.sh** from **sawyer_ws** while the robot is running.
