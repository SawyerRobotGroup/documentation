## Gitlab

* To work in the lab, first you will need to create a [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) account and get added to our group

Tim created a script to setup your computer in one command. It will ask you to set up ssh keys on your gitlab account, as well as a few other various things.

It has run into trouble before, so you might have to run it several times. Best to run it from your home directory.
