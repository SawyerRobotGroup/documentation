Browse the various pages to learn more about how and why we do things the way we do in the lab.

We use the Robot Operating System [ROS](https://ros.org) for controlling Sawyer.

For a lot of our user interfaces (UIs) we are transitioning over to and using Flutter.

Flutter uses the [dart](https://dart.dev) language. For more help with those see the resources on [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev), or the helpful hints in our [flutter docs](flutter/Flutter.md)
