## What is BlockMover?

The BlockMover script is used for instructing robots to move the blocks on the table.

## Setting up BlockMover

BlockMover expects the robot's manipulation and vision to have already been launched. It also expects that a planning scene has already been set up.

Specify which robot you are using BlockMover with by setting the rosparam 'robot' to either 'Fetch' or 'Sawyer'

At the time of writing, there is a script called BlockMoverLauncher that can be used with rosrun to start block mover, but it uses a hard coded scene, requires vision and manipulation to be running, and the user needs  to uncomment the code for the robot to set the rosparam to.

## Table positions

BlockMover uses a position system to describe the locations of blocks on the table. The position is specified by a Pose2D message. The X and Y should both be a value between 0 and 1. For example, from the player's view, (0,0) is the bottom left corner, (1,0) is the bottom right corner, and (1,1) is the top right corner.

## How to use BlockMover

BlockMover launches several simple action servers, and listens on several topics. Publish a message on one of those topics with "/goal" added to the end to have the robot perform the associated action.

Below are descriptions of each of the actions that can be performed.
