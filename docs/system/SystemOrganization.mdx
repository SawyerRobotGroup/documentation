## System Organization
The organization of our system is illustrated in the following image:
![System Diagram](/img/systemdiagram.png)

### Game Control & Visualizer

This module is kind of old. It is being replaced by:

- Control UI (in `game/control_server`)
- Game UI (in `game/ssharp/ssharp/ui`)
  However the code still exists in `game/control_panel`

### Game Server

- This is being replaced by the server in `game/control_server`
  However the code still exists in `game/game_flow/Robot/game_server.py`

### Game Flow

The code is currently in `game/game_flow/Robot/command_server.py`

### Manipulation

The code is in `manipulation/robot_control` and `manipulation/sawyer_wrappers` with some supporting stuff in `manipulation/moveit`, `manipulation/robot`, `manipulation/intera_sdk` and `manipulation/intera_common`

### Perception

The code is in `vision/vision_pipeline/scripts/perception.py` with some supporting stuff in that package and `vision/iai_kinect2`

### Face Tracker

The code is in `vision/vision_pipeline/scripts/face_tracker_kalman.py`

### Gaze / Eyes / Emotion / Face Services

These modules got moved to `communication/faces` when we changed our faces code

### Mic

This is in `communication/speech/speech_app` && `communication/speech/server`

### S# Algorithm

This is currently in `game/game_flow/Algorithm` but is planned on being reimplemented in a different language than C++ eventually.
