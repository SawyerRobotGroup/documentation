## Overview

*mic.py* is a python3 server that processes speech recieved from [the speech app](./Speech App.md), matches it to a valid speech act, and then send the verified speech to `game/game_flow/Robot/command_server.py` in game_flow.

Uses difflib to run the closest match from the speech recieved from the app and a list of accepted speech acts located in **communication/speech/resources/speechActs.txt**

The code for this project is in: `~/sawyer_ws/src/communication/speech/scripts`
