## Dart Resources

Videos: 
* This youtube channel [Dart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF-TBsgIErY&list=PLjxrf2q8roU0Net_g1NT5_vOO3s_FR02J) really nails some of the unique features of Dart

## Flutter Resources
The Flutter [docs](https://flutter.dev/docs) has many resources such as:
* Installation
* Widget Catalog
* API docs
* Basic tutorials
* Samples
* Videos

Full on courses:
* [zero-to-hero](https://caster.io/courses/flutter-from-zero-to-hero)

Other textual resources:
* For a widget reference see the [gallery](https://gallery.flutter.dev/#/)
* I would definitely go through the [layout](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout) section of the Flutter docs (all pages in the section)
* Google and Stackoverflow are also always good resources

Here are a few videos and concepts that I think are helpful if you are just starting out:
