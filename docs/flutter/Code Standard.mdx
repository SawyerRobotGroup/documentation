## Our Coding Standard for Dart/Flutter

To make things more uniform across all our repositories containing Dart/Flutter code we will abide by a coding standard

A nice thing about Dart is that it comes with a auto formatter and code analysis tool

`dartfmt` and `dartanalyze`

In your IDE be sure that auto-format on save is enabled, so that `dartfmt` will be automatically run any time you save a file.
We will also adhere to the recommended 80 character line limit that is enforced by `dartfmt`. We might increase this limit in our IDEs if we agree on a longer limit.

### Analysis
In VS Code there is a tab at the bottom called PROBLEMS. If you click on it, it will show a list of all problems in your files. 
The problems are not necessarily logical problems, just a list of guidelines to make your code more readable, and adhere to the standard. 

Analysis 'lints' the files checking for any issues, and displays them in the problems tab. You can also see this issues with a little blue squiggle under them in the editor. 
Hovering over them in the editor will show the issue that it found. Some errors can be corrected automatically. Just click `ctrl-.` to see the fix, and apply it if you see it. 
However, some problems must be corrected manually. Please do that. After making the edits the issue should go away.

### Creating a new project
When creating a new project, be sure to copy the `analysis_options.yaml` over from one of the existing projects to set up the code standard lints.

Or run:
* `pub global activate abide`
* `abide update`
If using abide to create the `analysis_options.yaml` from scratch, there are a couple of conflicting styles that the analyzer can check for.
You will have to comment out the lines that are conflicting or that we have chosen not to adhere to.

### Updating the lints
If dart updates their linter to add new rules we will need to choose whether they are rules we would like to enable or not.
My recommendation is to enable more rather than fewer.

To see the full current list of lint_rules see this [reference](https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/options/options.html)

Or run `abide update`. This will update the `analysis_options.yaml` with all new rules. 
* Make sure you have abide installed, and are in the project directory
* `pub global activate abide`
* `abide update`
Then see if there are any new problems that abide has found, and choose whether to fix them, or comment out the respective line in `analysis_options.yaml`
