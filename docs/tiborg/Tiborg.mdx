## Tiborg Robot Introduction

The robot we use is a Sawyer Robot from Rethink Robotics whom we call Tiborg.

This robot had a variety of different features

- 2 Cameras (though the Kinect is better so we do not use it)
- Jointed Arm
- Pneumatic Gripper
- LCD Display
- Sensors

### Some Basic Information

Set ROS master as Tiborg: (need to do this in every terminal that you want ROS to talk to Tiborg)
(This is what sourcing the `sawyer_ws/intera.sh` script does for you)
`export ROS_MASTER_URI="http://{robot hostname or ip}:11311"`

#### Turning it on and off

#### Emergency stop switch

#### How to move the arm manually

#### What some of the buttons do

To control and plan complicated movements, a porgram called [Move-It](https://moveit.ros.org/) is used.
